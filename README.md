# NeuroVault Images Tagged in Cognitive Atlas

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/vsoch/semantic-image-comparison-ci.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/vsoch/semantic-image-comparison-ci)

This is a continuous integration "reproducible repo," meaning that when the branch is rebuild on CircleCI, the resulting artifact is re-generated to produce an updated, interactive tree of Cognitive Atlas concepts and NeuroVault brain map images tagged to them. You can click the button above to find the artifacts and the base page under treeci/index.html. This reproducible repo is related to [recent work](http://www.github.com/vsoch/semantic-image-comparison) on the value of semantic image comparison for which a similar [web interface](http://www.vsoch.github.io/semantic-image-comparison-web) was generated to show "reverse inference" scores for NeuroVault images to Cognitive Atlas contrast nodes.
